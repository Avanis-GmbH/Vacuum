## üìù Example Commands

1. **Dry Run**: Simulate the process without moving any files.

   ```
   vacuum -root-dir=/path/to/source -target-dir=/path/to/target -dry
   ```

2. **Archiving Files Older than 5 Years**:

   ```
   vacuum -root-dir=/path/to/source -target-dir=/path/to/target -min-age=5
   ```

3. **Move and Shred**: Archive and securely delete original files.

   ```
   vacuum -root-dir=/path/to/source -target-dir=/path/to/target -min-age=3 -shred
   ```

4. **Disable Logging**:
   ```
   vacuum -root-dir=/path/to/source -target-dir=/path/to/target -nolog
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Dry Run**: Highly recommended to use the `-dry` flag before performing actual file operations to ensure everything works as expected.
- **No Log Option**: The `-nolog` flag disables logging entirely, which may make troubleshooting difficult. Use this option at your own risk.
- **File Shredding**: If the `-shred` flag is used, files will be permanently deleted from the source directory after transfer. This action cannot be undone.
