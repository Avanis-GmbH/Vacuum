## üìù Example Commands

1. **Dry Run**: Simulate the process without moving any files.

   ```bash
   vacuum -source=/path/to/source -target=/path/to/target -dry
   ```

2. **Archiving Files Older than 5 Years**:

   ```bash
   vacuum -source=/path/to/source -target=/path/to/target -age=5
   ```

3. **Move and Shred**: Archive and securely delete original files.

   ```bash
   vacuum -source=/path/to/source -target=/path/to/target -age=3 -shred
   ```

4. **Recursively Include Subdirectories**:

   ```bash
   vacuum -source=/path/to/source -target=/path/to/target -recurse
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Dry Run**: Highly recommended to use the `-dry` flag before performing actual file operations to ensure everything works as expected.
- **File Shredding**: If the `-shred` flag is used, files will be permanently deleted from the source directory after transfer. This action cannot be undone.
- **Recursive Option**: The `-recurse` flag enables processing of subdirectories.
